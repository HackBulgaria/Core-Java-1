2048
====

2048 game implemented in Java, in order to test whether it is good homework @ Core-Java-1 course.
Idea based on http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

### Running the game
Just download the `build/2048.jar` jar file, and run `java -jar <path-to-2048.jar>`   
Left arrow for moving everything to the left  
Right arrow for moving everything to the right, etc.
