###Implement a String join method### 
Java does not have a String join method. Apache StringUtils does have, but, well, that's not an excuse.

Make a method that joins strings, with a 'glue' given from the caller of your method.

Can you think of a way for it to work with every object, not just string? Even primitives?

`stichMeUp(" ", "Днес", "видях", 5, "ходещи", "медузи") => "Днес видях 5 ходещи медузи"` 

1) Think of a good name for this method
2) Make a test class
3) Make several test cases, see that your tests fail mightily : )
4) Implement! 

###Implement an 'eval' method in Java!###
Oh, no! What are we going to do? Java does not have an eval method!

Let's write one.

1) Don't think too much for a proper name of the method
2) Make a test class
3) Make several test cases and make sure they fail!
4) Implement!

*Note* There is a Utils class with some cool static methods. Check them out!
