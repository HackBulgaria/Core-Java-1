### JToaster

Ivan stays a lot on his computer. His mother is afraid he will spoils his vision.
As you know very well, you should take a break of at least 5 minutes (actually, it should be 15, but this *might* be outdated).

Help Ivan maintain his eagle-like vision. Write a program that waits 45 minutes, and the shows a notification saying 'Get a little rest, will you?' (or a message of your choosing :D) 

Use the incredibly-complex JToaster library. Download it from http://jtoaster.sourceforge.net/
Use the methods `showToaster`, `setToasterWidth`, `setToasterHeight`, `setToasterIcon`, `setToasterColor`, `setBackgroundImage`, `setStep`, etc. to customize and make the coolest toaster you can imagine. Also, set a nice background, something like

Also, check out the `Thread.sleep` method.
