### About this repo
Every folder in the repo starting with a number contains links/problems/materials about a specific subject/theme/area. 
They are usually named named `problems.md` - for the tasks you need to solve, `pre.md` - for the prereading you should do **beforehand**, and `materials.md` if you'd likely need to use the links/resources *while solving tasks from* `problems.md` .
